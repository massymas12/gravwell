# GravWell

Network mapping and attack path analysis tool for penetration testing.

GravWell ingests scan and assessment output from a wide range of tools, stores everything in an AES-256 encrypted SQLite database, and presents an interactive web UI for visualising the network graph, exploring vulnerabilities, and tracing attack paths between hosts.

---

## Features

- **Wide format support** — nmap, Nessus, Masscan, OpenVAS, Nuclei, enum4linux, CrowdStrike Falcon, Cisco IOS, Juniper JunOS, Fortinet FortiOS, Palo Alto PAN-OS (all auto-detected)
- **Encrypted database** — AES-256-GCM (SQLCipher 4) with per-user envelope encryption; stealing the `.db` file yields an unreadable blob without a valid GravWell password
- **Interactive network graph** — Dash + Cytoscape, automatic subnet grouping, drag-and-drop layout, multi-IP host support
- **Attack path analysis** — shortest path between any two hosts weighted by vulnerability severity
- **CVE enrichment** — CISA KEV + FIRST.org EPSS exploit probability signals fetched on demand
- **Multi-user** — admin and analyst roles, each user independently unlocks the database with their own password
- **Multi-project** — separate encrypted databases per engagement; create, rename, and delete from the sidebar
- **Active discovery** — ping sweep, ARP, TCP port scan, SNMP enumeration
- **CLI + Web UI** — full-featured CLI for scripted workflows, browser-based UI for analysis

## Supported Ingestion Formats

| Tool | Format | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **nmap** | XML (`.xml`) | Hosts, ports, services, OS detection, scripts |
| **Nessus** | `.nessus` (XML) | Vulnerabilities, CVEs, CVSS scores, plugin output |
| **Masscan** | JSON / XML | Fast port scan results |
| **OpenVAS / Greenbone** | XML report | Vulnerabilities, NVT details, CVSS |
| **Nuclei** | JSON / JSONL | Template-based vulnerability findings |
| **enum4linux** | Text output | SMB shares, users, groups, domain info |
| **CrowdStrike Falcon** | JSON export | Asset inventory, Spotlight vulnerability data |
| **Cisco IOS** | `show` command output | Interfaces, routing, ARP table, version |
| **Juniper JunOS** | `show` command output | Interfaces, routes, version |
| **Fortinet FortiOS** | `show` / `get` output | Interfaces, routing, system info |
| **Palo Alto PAN-OS** | XML operational output | Interfaces, routing, system info |

All formats are auto-detected. You can also force a specific parser with `--format`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- On **Linux**: `libsqlcipher-dev` must be installed before `pip install`

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install libsqlcipher-dev

# Arch
sudo pacman -S sqlcipher
```

On **Windows x64** and **macOS** the `sqlcipher3` wheel bundles the native library — no extra steps needed.

---

## Installation

### With `uv` (recommended)

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/massymas12/gravwell.git
```

### With `pip`

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/massymas12/gravwell.git
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/massymas12/gravwell.git
cd gravwell
pip install .
```

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Create the first user

The first user creation generates the database encryption key and encrypts the database.

```bash
gravwell user add admin --admin
# Enter and confirm a password when prompted
```

### 2. Start the web UI

```bash
gravwell serve --port 8050
```

Open `http://localhost:8050` and sign in.

### 3. Ingest scan data

Drag and drop scan files onto the web UI, or use the CLI:

```bash
gravwell ingest scan.xml
gravwell ingest results.nessus masscan_output.json
```

---

## CLI Reference

```
gravwell user add <username> [--admin]        Add a user
gravwell user delete <username>               Remove a user
gravwell user list                            List all users
gravwell passwd <username>                    Change a user's password

gravwell ingest <file> [<file>...]            Import scan files (auto-detected format)
gravwell ingest --format nmap <file>          Import with a forced parser

gravwell list hosts [--min-cvss N]            List discovered hosts
gravwell list hosts [--os Windows]            Filter by OS family
gravwell list hosts [--subnet 10.0.0.0/24]   Filter by subnet
gravwell list services [--ip IP] [--port N]   List open services
gravwell list vulns [--ip IP]                 List vulnerabilities

gravwell path <src-ip> <dst-ip>               Show attack path between two hosts

gravwell serve [--port PORT] [--host HOST]    Start the web server
gravwell reset                                Wipe all data in the current project
```

All data commands prompt for credentials to decrypt the database. Use `--db <path>` or set `GRAVWELL_DB` to target a specific project database:

```bash
gravwell --db ~/.gravwell/projects/client-acme.db ingest scan.xml
GRAVWELL_DB=~/.gravwell/projects/client-acme.db gravwell list hosts
```

---

## Projects

Projects are separate encrypted databases — one per engagement is recommended. Manage them from the sidebar in the web UI (New / Rename / Delete) or target them directly via the CLI.

Default database: `~/.gravwell/gravwell.db`
Project databases: `~/.gravwell/projects/<name>.db`

---

## Adding Users

Additional users require an existing authenticated account to add:

```bash
gravwell user add analyst
# Prompts for your credentials first, then the new user's password
```

Each user holds their own encrypted copy of the database key. All users share the same data within a project.

---

## Security Notes

- The database is encrypted with AES-256-GCM (SQLCipher 4). The key is derived from your password using PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (480,000 iterations).
- The master encryption key lives in memory only while the server is running. Restarting the server clears the key and forces re-authentication — the database is locked at rest.
- User accounts are stored in `~/.gravwell/gravwell.keystore.json` (plaintext JSON, separate from the encrypted database to avoid a bootstrapping problem — contains no scan data).
- The Flask session secret is stored in `~/.gravwell/gravwell.key` (mode 0600).
- Never commit `.db`, `.keystore.json`, or `.key` files.
